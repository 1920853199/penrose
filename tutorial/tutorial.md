# âœ¨ Welcome, we are so glad you are here.

This tutorial consists of 3 individual exercises, teaching you all the skills you would need to make your own domain from scratch! Each exercise builds on the concepts taught in the previous exercise(s), so we highly recommend you to follow through and understand each exercise as you go. Feel free to shoot us a message if you get stuck anywhere at team@penrose.ink.

# Installation
We have a detailed wiki page on how to get Penrose up and running on your computer [here](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/Getting-started). Come back when you are done. 

# What makes a Penrose program? 
Every Penrose program consists of 3 files: A `.dsl`  file that defines the language specific to the domain, a `.sub` file that creates substances of mathematical content, and lastly, a `.sty` file that specifies the style of the visual representation. We call a group of these programs (**DOMAIN, SUBSTANCE, STYLE**) that can be used together a "triple."

> Rest assured, you do not need to understand how it is compiled and rendered to start creating diagrams using Penrose. 

After following the getting started page, you should now have forked Penrose and have created a new folder in the `penrose/examples` path. So you should have something like this.

# ðŸ“– Exercise (1)
This is the first diagram we will make together. This is the equivalent of ```print("Hello World")``` program for Penrose.
