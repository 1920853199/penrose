# ‚ú® Welcome, we are so glad you are here.
Ready to make some beautiful diagrams? You are at the right place. This tutorial is targeted towards absolute beginners who are excited to curate visualizations on mathematical topics with Penrose. :student:

# What's in this tutorial? 
This tutorial consists 3 individual sections, each containing the following content:
- **A Worked Example**
    - We will hold your hand to write and most importantly understand each line of code. Furthermore, we will be teaching you how to navigate in the Penrose repository for all the resources you need in the future. 
- **Exercises (with solutions)**
    - These exercises act as sanity checks to confirm that you have comprehended the worked example. The exercises will be very similar to the worked example, and will be a walk in the park if you fully understood the worked examples. We also have the solutions available for you to check your work. 
  
The sections build on top of each other, using the skillset we've acquired in the previous exercises, therefore we highly recommend you to follow through one by one. 

# Installation
We have a detailed wiki page on how to get Penrose up and running on your computer [here](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/Building-and-running). :partying_face: Come back when you are done.

After following the Building & Running page, you should now have forked Penrose and have created a new folder in the `penrose/examples` path. So you should have something like this.

![initialize files](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/blob/docs-edit/assets/tutorial/initializa_file.png)

With the neccessary tools set up, we can finally start making Penrose programs that will produce beautiful visualizations for you. Before talking about any code, a basic understanding of a Penrose program will benefit you so you feel less overwhelmed. Learning a new environment can be intimidating, and we want to make that process go as smooth as it can possibly be.

# How do we diagram by hand? 
Now, for a second, I want you to recall how you would normally diagram a concept using a pen or pencil. 

It will most likely involve the following steps,
* **Decide on what you are diagramming**
    * There must be something that you wanted to diagram, so you are here pondering how to diagram it. 
    * Let's say we are making a diagram of things in your house, then the **domain** of objects that we are working with includes furnitures, plants, utensils, and everything that is in your house. Furthermore, furniture / plants / utensils are specific types of objects in your houses (the domain). 
* **Have a (mental) list of the objects you want to include in the diagram**
    * We either write down, or mentally construct the list of objects that will be included in our diagram.
    * They are the **substances** of our diagram that we will see. 
    * For example, your chair :chair: is a particular instance of an object in the domain that has the type of _furniture_. If you wanted to include your chair in the diagram, then it is a substance of the diagram. 
* **Figure out the relationships between the objects**
    *  If we were only to put the list of things on paper, that would not be an interesting nor useful diagram. Normally, there are relationships we want to visualize through diagramming. 
    * For example, we could group the plants based on the number of times they need to be watered on a weekly basis. Then we would have visual clusters of elements.
* **Explore different visual styles**
    * Drawings commonly require explorations and various attempts with colors, sizes, and compositions. The same concept can be visualized in a number of different **styles**. 

### In fact, the process of creating a Penrose diagram is _extremely_ similar to our intuitive process of analogue diagramming. :tada: 

# What makes a Penrose program? 
It follows naturally from the process of diagramming by hand, we need to store information about our **domain** of objects so Penrose understands you, the specific **substances** we want to include in our diagrams, and the **styles** we want to visualize our concept in. Each of these corresponds to a specific file with an intuitive file extension designed for accessibility. 

Every Penrose program consists of 3 files: 
* A `.dsl`  file that defines the language specific to the domain.
* A `.sub` file that creates substances of mathematical content.
* A `.sty` file that specifies the style of the visual representation. 

We call a group of these programs (**DOMAIN, SUBSTANCE, STYLE**) that can be used together a "triple." 

![triple](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/blob/docs-edit/assets/tutorial/triple.png)

:seedling: _Rest assured, you do not need to understand how it is compiled and rendered to start creating diagrams using Penrose._

In general, for each diagram, you will have an individual `.sub` file that contains the specific instances for the diagram, while the `.dsl` and `.sty` files can be applied to a number of different diagrams. For example, we can have various diagrams in the domain of Linear Algebra that visualizes different concepts with different `.sub` files, but we would have a main `linearAlgebra.dsl` file and `linearAlgebra.sty` file. 

# Example (1)
This is the first diagram we will make together. This is the equivalent of ```print("Hello World")``` program for Penrose.

![exercise 1 result](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/blob/docs-edit/assets/tutorial/2sets_nolabel.png)

This is what you will end up with at the end of our exercise 1. 

### What is this? 
Some of you who have experiences with set theory may recognize that ellipses are common for representing sets, and that's exactly what we have here. We have 2 sets without names (we will get to labeling later :grimacing:).

### :page_facing_up: DOMAIN
It follows naturally that our mathematical **domain** is the set theory. Therefore, we can rename our `.dsl` file to `setTheory.dsl`. Now recall what does a `.dsl` file do? It defines the language we use to describe the specific mathematical domain. 

#### :question: POP QUIZ: What's the most fundamental type of element in set theory? (hint: the name gives it away.)

The answer is a **Set**! A set is a **type** of element in set theory. Therefore in our `setTheory.dsl`, we write the following line,
`setTheory.dsl`
```typescript
type Set
```
And that is all we need for this exercise in `.dsl`! :tada:

If you look closely, we have a `penrose/examples/set-theory-domain/setTheory.dsl` file that contains more extensive operations common in set theory such as `Intersection, Union, Subset`, and more. 

### :page_facing_up: SUBSTANCE
Since we are only visualizing 2 sets named A and B, they are our mathematical **substances** for this diagram. 

We declare a substance by first declaring it's *type* followed by it's *name*. Therefore if we want to have a set named A in our visualization, we declare it using `Set A`. Here we have capitalized `Set` because recall in our `setTheory.dsl` file, we wrote `type Set`, and if we did `type set` instead, we would declare our set with `set A` here. Again, we will rename our file to be more descriptive of the content, therefore rename the `.sub` file to `twosets.sub`. 

We want two sets in our diagram, and since they are nameless, it doesn't really matter what you name them. We simply need to declare two sets. 

`twosets.sub`
```typescript
Set A 
Set B 
```

Now, Penrose will know that you want two substances of type `Set` in your diagram. :tada:

### :page_facing_up: STYLE
For style, we have a little more work to do. A `.sty` file is essentially a `.css` file for your `html`(which wouold be our `.sub` file). Since we are only styling our diagram for the two sets, we will rename our `.sty` file to `twosets.sty`. 

Now, Penrose do _not_ know what a set is, it does _not_ know a set is commonly represented as a circle. **We need to style our elements from scratch.** This might seem strange, but this way you are given absolute freedom in how you want to represent your substances in the diagram. Your Set doesn't have to be a circle, it can be square, a rectangle, etc. But for this example, we will be representing sets as circles. 

The syntax for declaring styles goes like this,

![style syntax](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/blob/docs-edit/assets/tutorial/style_syntax.png)

Note that the syntax is _very_ similar to the mathematical way of talking about objects, so it should be pretty natural for people with some backgrounds in higher math. 

Here we have our `type t` as `Set`, and we want to all of our sets to be a circle. We can make that happen by setting the `.icon` field to a shape object. 

`twosets.sty`
```typescript
forall Set x {
    x.icon = (* some shape object *)
}
```

So, what are the shapes we can use? Currently, the system supports 12 different shapes, and you can find the specs for everyshape [here](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/Shape-library).

![Circle Spec](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/blob/docs-edit/assets/tutorial/circle_spec.png)

When we construct the `Circle` object for our Set, we can pass in arguments for the listed attributes to override the default values. Our desired circles here are strokeless, therefore we will set `strokeWidth: 0.0`.  

`twosets.sty`
```typescript
forall Set x {
    x.icon =  Circle {
        strokeWidth : 0.0
    }
}
```
And that's a wrap! :tada: 

### COMPILE
Now it's time to see all of our hardwork! (drumroll please ü•Å) To compile your Penrose programs (more detailed description [here](https://github.com/penrose/penrose/wiki/Getting-started)), you need 
* two terminals opened both at the penrose root directory
* run `yarn start` in one to get the browser window to pop out
* run `roger watch twosets.sub twosets.sty setTheory.dsl` to send the files over to the server
* Refresh!
