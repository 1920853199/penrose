# Things to do for hyperbolic geometry:

- choose the model of hyperbolic geometry: POINCARE DISK MODEL
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk_model
  (circular, NOT Klein (z=1), NOT Poincare II)

	A line is the arc of a circle? How do I do that?

A point (x,y) in the Poincaré disk model maps to {\displaystyle \left({\frac {2x}{1+x^{2}+y^{2}}}\ ,\ {\frac {2y}{1+x^{2}+y^{2}}}\right)}{\displaystyle \left({\frac {2x}{1+x^{2}+y^{2}}}\ ,\ {\frac {2y}{1+x^{2}+y^{2}}}\right)} in the Klein model.

A point (x,y) in the Klein model maps to {\displaystyle \left({\frac {x}{1+{\sqrt {1-x^{2}-y^{2}}}}}\ ,\ \ {\frac {y}{1+{\sqrt {1-x^{2}-y^{2}}}}}\right)}{\displaystyle \left({\frac {x}{1+{\sqrt {1-x^{2}-y^{2}}}}}\ ,\ \ {\frac {y}{1+{\sqrt {1-x^{2}-y^{2}}}}}\right)} in the Poincaré disk model.

The Wikipedia page includes lines and angles as well!

  write out eqns: ???

  figure out how it relates to the spherical model: ???

- figure out the following representations:
  point: a point on a 3D hyperboloid: (x,y,z) such that x^2 + y^2 + 1 = z^2
         -> project onto the Poincare disk (1/(z+1)) (x y)

  line through two points: the endpoints of the line are the circle that's perpendicular to the edge (have to construct it using circle inversion)

  segment:  two points on the 3D hyperboloid
         -> sample the points between them on the hyperboloid (how?) ???
	 Turn a *geodesic* on the hyperboloid into a *geodesic* on the Poincare disk

		    What is a segment on a hyperboloid? It's the intersection of the plane. Or use the Mark method to get everything in Klein ???
	     -> project each point onto the Poincare disk

  ray:      ?
         -> ?

  triangle: three points on the 3D hyperboloid
         -> sample 3 segments and project onto the Poincare disk

- figure out the following operations:
  midpoint of a segment
  angle between two segments
  triangle (from three points)
  bisector of an angle
  perpendicular bisector of a segment

- draw a spec diagram for this

- implement the operations

- make several diagrams

- make the diagrams look good
