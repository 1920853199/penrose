Changes made in new Style program:

# Types in blocks

# Allow local variables

# Vectors should be first-class type in Style

* https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Data_Type_(GLSL)#Vectors
* https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLSL_Programming/Vector_and_Matrix_Operations

# Inline function declarations

Where are these typed, where are these declared?

(hard to do any one feature in isolation)

# Getting and setting derived properties

# Style modules

---

# Design questions

- Initialization
- Casting
- Getting and setting
- Pending variables -- where do they appear?
- *Setting shape properties together*
- *Getting shape properties together*
- Operators
- Built-in functions
- Example code
  - SIGGRAPH paper, Fig. 12
  - Maybe also euclidean.sty?
- Do we also want matrices? 
- How to keep this backward-compatible? (If at all?)
- What is the priority of this?
