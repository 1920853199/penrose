# Types in blocks



# Allow local variables



# Vectors should be first-class type in Style

# Inline function declarations

Where are these typed, where are these declared?

(hard to do any one feature in isolation)

# Getting and setting derived properties

# Style modules

## Design

- Initialization
- Casting
- Getting and setting
- Pending variables -- where do they appear?
- *Setting shape properties together*
- *Getting shape properties together*
- Operators
- Built-in functions
- Example code

SIGGRAPH paper fig 12 needs an overhaul
-- Maybe euclidean.sty?

Do we also want matrices? --> Transforms

How to keep this backward-compatible? (If at all?)

What is the priority of this?

## Implementation
